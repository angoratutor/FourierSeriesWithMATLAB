# FourierSeriesWithMATLAB
A MATLAB App to exploer Fourier series analysis and synthesis together with Fourier series properties. You can interractively see how the Fourier series approximation of a signal changes as the number of harmonics used in the approximation changes. Also, you can explore the Fourier series properties such as linearity, time reversal and convolution visually. 

Please provide feedback on how I can make it better. Better yet, please contribute.
